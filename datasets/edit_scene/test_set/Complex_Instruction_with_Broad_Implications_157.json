we'll keep the characters and location the same, but adjust the actions and effects to show emma bringing multiple drawings to life. here's how we'll update the json:\n\n1. update the voice_over to introduce emma's new ability.\n2. modify the description to reflect the new plot.\n3. change the scene_summary to encompass emma's newfound power.\n4. adjust the shots to show emma bringing multiple drawings to life, not just sparkle.\n5. add more variety to the sfx_keywords to represent different drawings coming to life.\n6. keep the characters, location, lighting, and weather the same as they still fit the new scenario.\n\nthese changes will create a more dynamic and exciting scene while maintaining the magical and whimsical atmosphere of the original."}, "json_diff": [],
