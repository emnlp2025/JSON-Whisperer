need to adjust some of the shots to fit the new setting and time of day. here's how we'll approach these changes:\n\n1. update the location to \"colosseum, rome\"\n2. change the lighting to reflect a nighttime scene with torchlight\n3. adjust the weather to be more appropriate for a night in rome\n4. modify the ambience_sound_keywords to fit the new location and time\n5. update relevant shots to
