of trying to stop it. this change will add an interesting twist to the story, showcasing a law enforcer who decides to side with the movement. we'll need to modify the character description for officer briggs, adjust the relevant shots, and update the scene summary to reflect this change. here's how we'll approach these changes:\n\n1. update officer briggs' character description to reflect his new role.\n2. modify the shot where officer briggs appears (shot \"ka\") to show him joining the protest.\n3. adjust the following shots to incorporate officer briggs' participation in the movement.\n4. update the scene summary to include this new development.\n\nthese changes will create a more dynamic and unexpected turn of events in the scene, adding depth to officer briggs' character and potentially increasing the impact of luna's art on the community."}, "json_diff": [], "validation_labels": []}
