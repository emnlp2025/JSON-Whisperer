the scene into a film noir style mystery set at night, with sherlock bones as a hard-boiled detective. this transformation will involve changing the lighting, weather, ambience, and the tone of the shots to reflect the noir style. we'll also adjust sherlock's character to fit the hard-boiled detective archetype. here's how we'll make these changes:\n\n1. update the scene's setting to nighttime\n2. change the lighting and weather to reflect a noir atmosphere\n3. adjust the ambience sound keywords to fit a nighttime urban setting\n4. modify the voice over to have a more noir-style narration\n5. update sherlock's character description to fit a hard-boiled detective\n6. revise the shots to incorporate noir elements and nighttime settings\n7. adjust the scene name and summary to reflect the new noir style\n\nthese changes will create a dramatically different atmosphere while maintaining the core mystery plot and sherlock bones as the protagonist."}, "json_diff": [],
