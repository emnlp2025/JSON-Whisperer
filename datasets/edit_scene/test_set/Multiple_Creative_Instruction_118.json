lighting, weather, and ambience sound keywords to reflect the rainy day setting.\n2. modify the voice-over to align with the new melancholic mood.\n3. adjust each shot's action and sfx keywords to incorporate rain elements and a more somber atmosphere.\n4. maintain the overall structure and flow of the scene while emphasizing the themes of melancholy and the passage of time.\n\nthese changes
