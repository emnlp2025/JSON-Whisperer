developing friendship. here's how we'll update the json:\n\n1. change the weather from \"clear and sunny\" to \"thunderstorm\"\n2. update the lighting to reflect the darker, stormy conditions\n3. modify the ambience_sound_keywords to include thunder and rain sounds\n4. adjust the voice_over to hint at the new thunderstorm context\n5. update relevant shots to incorporate the thunderstorm and zax's reaction to it\n6. add emily's comforting actions towards zax in response to his fear\n\nthese changes will create a more dramatic and emotionally charged scene while maintaining the core story of zax learning about friendship from emily."}, "json_diff": [{"op": "replace", "path": "/voice_over", "value": "In the vastness of the universe, sometimes the greatest comfort comes from the smallest
