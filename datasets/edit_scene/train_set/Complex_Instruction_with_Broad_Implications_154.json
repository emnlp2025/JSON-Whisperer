modify the scene to reflect the new scenario where whiskers prevents julius caesar's assassination instead of altering his meeting with cleopatra. this requires significant changes to the scene's setting, characters, and actions. we'll update the location to rome, remove cleopatra from the scene, and introduce new characters like the conspirators. the shots will be restructured to show whiskers' intervention in the assassination attempt. here's how we'll approach the changes:\n\n1. update the scene name, voice over, description, and summary to reflect the new plot.\n2. change the location to the senate in rome.\n3. adjust the lighting and ambience to match the new setting.\n4. remove cleopatra from the characters list and add the conspirators.\n5. modify the shots to depict whiskers preventing caesar's assassination.\n6. keep dr. chronos in the scene but adjust his role slightly.\n\nthese changes will maintain the time-traveling cat concept while dramatically altering the historical event being affected."}, "json_diff": [], "validation_labels": []}
