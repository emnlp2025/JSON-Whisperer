that the given json structure does not contain any information about background music or its volume. the json represents a scene description with various shots, actions, and sound effects, but there is no specific field or parameter for background music or its volume control. therefore, we cannot apply this command to the existing json structure without modifying its schema, which is outside the scope of our task."}, "json_diff": [], "validation_labels": []}
