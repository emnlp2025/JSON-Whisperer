adjust the lighting and potentially some of the shot descriptions to maintain consistency. here's how we'll make these changes:\n\n1. change the \"weather\" from \"clear night\" to \"stormy night\".\n2. update the \"lighting\" from \"soft, warm glow\" to something more fitting for a stormy night, like \"dim, with occasional flashes of lightning\".\n3. add thunder sounds to the \"ambience_sound_keywords\".\n4. adjust the first shot (qa) to reflect the stormy weather visible through the window.\n5. modify the \"voice_over\" slightly to incorporate the stormy
