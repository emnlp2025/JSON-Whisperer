between each shot is unsupported in this context. this is because the current json structure does not have a dedicated field or mechanism to represent transitions between shots. adding transitions would require modifying the json schema, which is beyond the scope of the current editing capabilities. transitions are typically a post-production element that would be applied during the editing process, rather than being part of the scene description or shot list. to implement this, we would need to introduce a new field or structure to the json to accommodate transition information between shots, which would alter the existing schema."}, "json_diff": [], "validation_labels": []}
